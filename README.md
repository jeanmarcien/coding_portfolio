## <u>Project 1</u>
### CleanLife: A Data Cleaning Project for Life Insurance Policies
This project involves visualizing the Titanic dataset using R and RMarkdown to perform exploratory data analysis and generate various plots. The visualizations include a count plot to show the number of survivors, a bar plot to illustrate the survival rate by passenger class, a violin plot to display age distribution by survival status, a correlation heatmap to reveal relationships between numerical features, and a facet grid to analyze survival rates by age and sex. These visualizations provide insights into the Titanic dataset, demonstrating the use of R for data analysis and visualization.

<u>Programming Language Used</u>: R, RMarkdown

## <u>Project 2</u>
### CleanLife: A Data Cleaning Project for Life Insurance Policies
The Life Insurance Data Cleaning Project aims to clean and standardize a messy dataset related to life insurance policies. The dataset includes fields such as policy ID, policy holder's name, age, date of birth, email, phone, address, policy amount, policy term, policy start date, policy status, and beneficiary name, initially containing numerous issues like missing values, inconsistent formats, and invalid data entries. The cleaning process involves handling missing values by filling or dropping them, correcting data types, standardizing data formats, removing duplicates, and validating data to ensure accuracy and consistency. By following these steps, the project transforms the dataset into a clean, reliable, and analysis-ready format, serving as a practical guide for preparing messy datasets for data analysis or machine learning tasks.

<u>Programming Language Used</u>: Python

## <u>Project 3</u>
### English Soccer Premier League: Data Retrieval and Storage Project
The project involves retrieving Premier League data from an API and storing it in an SQLite database. The script starts by sending a GET request to the API using specific headers that include an API key. Upon successful retrieval of the data, it proceeds to set up a local SQLite database. Within the database, it creates two tables: "teams" and "stats". The "teams" table stores information about each team, such as their name, logo, and abbreviation, while the "stats" table holds various statistics including wins, losses, ties, games played, goals for, goals against, points, rank, and goal difference. The data is extracted from the API response and inserted into the respective tables. Finally, the changes are committed, and the database connection is closed. If the API request fails, an error message with the status code is printed.

<u>Programming Language Used</u>: Python, SQL

## <u>Project 4</u>
### Password Manager: Secure Password Management and Encryption Project
This project involves developing a secure and user-friendly password manager using a Bash script. It includes functionalities for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting passwords, with a focus on security and ease of use. The script evaluates password strength based on specific criteria, encrypts and decrypts the password file using "gpg", and offers an option for generating secure random passwords. Additionally, it integrates with the clipboard for convenient password management and features an interactive menu-driven interface for a seamless user experience.

<u>Programming Language Used</u>: Bash Scripting

## <u>Project 5</u>
### System Monitoring Tool: Comprehensive Resource Usage Monitoring Project
This project involves creating a Bash script-based system monitoring tool that provides real-time information on CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space usage. The tool features an interactive menu, allowing users to select and view individual metrics or all metrics simultaneously. It ensures efficient monitoring and management of system resources through a user-friendly interface, making it an essential tool for maintaining system performance and health.
