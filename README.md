### CleanLife: A Data Cleaning Project for Life Insurance Policies
The Life Insurance Data Cleaning Project aims to clean and standardize a messy dataset related to life insurance policies. The dataset includes fields such as policy ID, policy holder's name, age, date of birth, email, phone, address, policy amount, policy term, policy start date, policy status, and beneficiary name, initially containing numerous issues like missing values, inconsistent formats, and invalid data entries. The cleaning process involves handling missing values by filling or dropping them, correcting data types, standardizing data formats, removing duplicates, and validating data to ensure accuracy and consistency. By following these steps, the project transforms the dataset into a clean, reliable, and analysis-ready format, serving as a practical guide for preparing messy datasets for data analysis or machine learning tasks.
